<h1>Best movie according to HaziqMirza</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movie of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avangers: Endgame</h3>
<p>
Happens to be the first movie I watch in cinema and it was very good. Try my best not to spoil but the fight and sacrifice 
to defeat the villian is absolutely fantastic.
</p>

<h3>Spiderman: No way home</h3>

<p>
The multiverse concept is really interesting where there has different version of you in every other univers. But the quastion, 
what could happen if we brought our favourite person from other univers to one univers where we live. This movie really done it
job perfectly. But mostly what makes thing fun is the jokes after jokes that this movie deliver.

<h3>Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King</h3>

<p>
For people who wait patienly for this movie to come out is really worth the wait. Although the story is non canon, it's really
interesting that we introduced to previous wizzard king. The fight also not dissapointing but too much if you ask me. The 
animation is really good. What to expect from anime beside the animation?
